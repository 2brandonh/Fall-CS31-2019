# Fall-CS31-2019
Introduction to Computer Science at UCLA using C++. Several of these projects have frameworks created by David A. Smallberg, the CS31 professor at UCLA, while the implementations were designed by students.




**Do not copy the code in these projects directly. As the CS professors change project specifications each quarter, doing so will result in an academic violation and likely a poor grade. This repository is here for my personal reference and to showcase my development in programming over time.**

# Project 1
Basic experimenting with C++ and an IDE. The project asked for a compile, logic, and runtime error to be created within given code.

# Project 2
The project calculates the suggested fine for a defendant convicted of fraud in the college admissions scandal. Faking athletic credentials results in a more serious punishment and the rates are set to those in the project specification. The goal was to manage if, else, and else if statements in C++.

# Project 3
Using a premade utilities file that created an array for a drawing grid, the objective for this project was to create an ASCII drawing application. Commands include "h" for horizontal lines, "v" for vertical lines, "c" for clearing the board, "f" for drawing in the foreground, and "b" for drawing in the background. A command line was required in this project where each command would be parsed and their respective functions used.

# Project 4
The project focused on arrays and implementing functions to manipulate them. These include appending, looking up an item, rotating a string left, checking for duplicates, reversing order, finding subsequences, looking if an item is in two arrays, and ordering an array.

# Project 5
The flowers and bee game is a guessing based word game. A word is randomly chosen from a 10,000 word file. For each word inputted into the terminal, a number of flowers and bees is returned until the word is guessed correctly. Flowers occur when the position and letter in two words matchup. Bees occur when a letter in two words matchup but their positions are different.

# Project 6
This project focused on an introduction to pointers, how to use them with arrays and brackets, and how to use the "->" operator.

# Project 7
The class's final project involved a top down survival game titled "Bad Blood." The goal is to eliminate all the zombies on the board. THe player can move via one of the direction keys "n/e/s/w" or place a poison vial "x". When a vampire lands on a poison tile, its movement will become slowed and the tile will be cleared. If it lands on a second poison tile, it will die and the tile will be cleared.

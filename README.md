# Fall-CS31-2019
Introduction to Computer Science at UCLA using C++. Several of these projects have frameworks created by David A. Smallberg, the CS31 professor at UCLA, while the implementations were designed by students.




**Do not copy the code in these projects directly. As the CS professors change project specifications each quarter, doing so will result in an academic violation and likely a poor grade. This repository is here for my personal reference and to showcase my development in programming over time.**

# Project 1
Basic experimenting with C++ and an IDE. The project asked for a compile, logic, and runtime error to be created within given code.

# Project 2
The project calculates the suggested fine for a defendant convicted of fraud in the college admissions scandal. Faking athletic credentials results in a more serious punishment and the rates are set to those in the project specification.
